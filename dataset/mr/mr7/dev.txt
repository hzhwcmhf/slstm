1 a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
0 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
0 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
1 much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
0 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
1 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
0 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
0 jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .

1 one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
0 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere .

0 should have been someone else-
1 a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
1 at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 
0 normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .

0 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
0 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
1 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
0 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
0 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
0 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
1 surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
1 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 
0 elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
0 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
1 maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors . 
0 a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
0 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable navet and arbitrary flashbacks . 
0 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
0 even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
1 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .

1  . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness . 
0 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
0 in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
0 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
0 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
0 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
0 yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
1  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
1 in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
1 the subtle strength of " elling " is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . 
1 both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 
1 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia flmica imposible de olvidar'
0 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
0 leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion . 
0 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
0  . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
1 this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
0 it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
0 it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
0 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
1 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
1 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
1 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
0 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
1 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama . 
0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
1 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
0  . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
0 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
0 i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on bttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
0 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
1 there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
0 entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
1 an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
1 ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
0 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
0 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
1 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
1 it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
0 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .

1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
0 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
0 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
0 observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
0 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
1 like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
0 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
0 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
0 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
0 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
0 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
0 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
1 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
0 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
0 morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
0  . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
1 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
1 contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memria . 
0 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
0 you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
1 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
0 [t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
1 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
1 neatly constructed thriller . 
0 there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
1 it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
0 a complete waste of time . 
0 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
1 a deep and meaningful film . 
0 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
0 [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
0 it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call . 
0  . . . salaciously simplistic . 
0 a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
0 if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
0 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
0 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
1 the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
0 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
1 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
1 still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
1 watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
1 this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare . 
1 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . 
1 aside from rohmer's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art . 
1 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
1 oddly , the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
0 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
0 it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
1 though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
1 the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain . 
1 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . 
0 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
0 it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
0 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
0 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
1 fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
1 the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 
0 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
1 amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . 
0 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
0 after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
0 maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
1 a well-executed spy-thriller . 
0 whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
0 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
1 a delightful coming-of-age story . 
1 another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
1 it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
0 there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
0 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
0 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
1 the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
1 another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
1 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
0  . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
0 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
1 moving and vibrant . 
0 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
0 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
0 few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
0 it drowns in sap . 
0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
0 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
0 it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
1 the performances are uniformly good . 
0 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
0 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
1 mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
0 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
0 although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
1 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
0 this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
0 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
1 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . 
0 just a bloody mess . 
0 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .

1 old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
0 an extraordinarily silly thriller .

1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
0 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
0 the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
0 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
1 otto-sallies has a real filmmaker's eye . 
0 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
1 poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
1 even better than the first one ! 
0 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
0 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
1 in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
0 the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
0 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
0 though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
1 i admired this work a lot . 
0 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
0 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
0  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
0 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
1 this english-language version . . . does full honor to miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters . 
1 [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
0  . . . they missed the boat . 
0 [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . 
0 oozes condescension from every pore . 
0 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
0 talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
1 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
1 if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
1 ice age won't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up . 
1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
0 it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
0 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
0 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
1 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
0 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
1 davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
0 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
1 special p . o . v . camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
0 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
0 you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
1 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
0 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
1 the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
1 most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; " frailty " leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
0 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
0 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
0 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
1 ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
0 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
0 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
0 circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
0 as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
1 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . 
1 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
0 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
1 this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
0 in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
0 harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
0 the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
0 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
1 birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
0 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
0 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
1 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
0 it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
1 highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting . 
0 the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
0 the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
0 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
1 you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
1 it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
0 when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
0 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
0 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
0 a well-acted , but one-note film . 
0 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
0 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
1 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
0 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
0 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful clich in the book at this nonsensical story . 
1 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story . 
1  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
0 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
0 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
0 morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
1 elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
1 its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . 
1 the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
0 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
0 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
0 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
1 the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment . 
0 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
1  ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
1 while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible . 
1 there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
0 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
0 showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
1 'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
1 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom  handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus . 
0 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
0 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
0 at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
0 the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
1 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez . 
1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
0 this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
0 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
0 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
