0 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
1 it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming . 
1 an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
0 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
0 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
0 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
0 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
0 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
1 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
0 its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
0 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
0 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
1 fantastic ! 
1 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
0 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
0 many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
0 a well-crafted letdown . 
0 it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
0 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . 
1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
1 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
1 allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duracin
1 a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
1 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
0 god is great , the movie's not . 
0 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
1 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
1 more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it . 
0 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
0 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
1 in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players . 
0 the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
0 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
0 an uninspired preachy and clichd war film . 
0 it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
0 it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
0 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
0 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
0 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
0 this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
1 it's definitely a step in the right direction . 
1 the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
1  uma pena que , mais tarde , o prprio filme abandone o tom de pardia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichs que havia satirizado . 
1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
0 [l]ame and unnecessary . 
1 a wonderful , ghastly film . 
0 it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
1 the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis . 
0 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
0 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
0 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
1 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
0 impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
1 baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children . 
1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
1 a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
0 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
0 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
1 a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession  one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
1 the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
1 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a direct-to-video' release . 
1 rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
1  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
0 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
0 a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
0 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
0 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
0 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
1 skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
0 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
0 writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
1 i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
0 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
0 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
1 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
1 nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
1 a moving and important film . 
0 the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
0 it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
0 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
0 mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
1 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
1 in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
1 this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
1 this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
0 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
0 the story has little wit and no surprises . 
1 the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
0 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
0 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
1 all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
1 the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
0 plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
1 there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
0 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
1 all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
0 distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
0 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
0 is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
0 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
1 a thought-provoking picture . 
0 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
1 it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
0 it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mtier . 
1 the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
0 hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
0 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
1 in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue . 
1 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . 
1 sleek and arty . 
1 the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
1 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
1 lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
0 if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
0 ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes . 
1 it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously . 
1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
0 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
0  . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
0 the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
0 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
0 it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
0 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
1 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
0 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
0 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
0 for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
1 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . 
0 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
1 for all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
1 cold , nervy and memorable . 
1 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
1 seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . 
1 the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
1 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
1 it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
0 there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
0 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
0 high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
1 the all-french cast is marveilleux . 
1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie . 
1 the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
0 we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
1 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
1 a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch . 
0 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
0 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
0 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
1 it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
1 the film is one of the year's best . 
0  " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
0 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
1 labute's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering . 
1 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
0 there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
1 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others . 
1 i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
0 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
0 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
1 an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
0 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
0 demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
0 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
0 freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
0 boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
1 this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
1 it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
0 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
0 one of the worst films of 2002 . 
1 it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
0 it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
0 as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
0 the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
1 [allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
1 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
0 co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
0 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
1 an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work . 
0 falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
1 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
1 a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 
1 some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
0 for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
1 the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
1 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
0 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
0 snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
1 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
0 episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
1  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
1 a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
0 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
0 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
1 we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it . 
1 a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy . 
0 sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
1 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
0 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
0 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
1 the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away . 
1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
0 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess . 
0 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
1 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . 
1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
1 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
1 a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
0  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
0 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
1 it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
0 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
0 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
0 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
0 now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
0 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
1 i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
0 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
0 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
1 for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
0 it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
1 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
0 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
1 wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
0 scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
1 polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
1 una pelcula oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora . 
1 witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
1 there's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . but here's a glimpse at his life . 
0 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
1 maryam is more timely now than ever . 
0 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
0 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
0 this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
1 the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
1 constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
1 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
0 in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
0 a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
0 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
1 director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
1 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
1 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
0 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
0 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
1 the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities . 
1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
0 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
1 that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
1 a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
0 sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
0 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
1 schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
1 yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it .

0 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
1 the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .

1 a lovely film for the holiday season . 
1 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
0 schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .

0 the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
1 an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot
1 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .

1 we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
0 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
1 a gem of a movie . 
1 a tasty slice of droll whimsy . 
1 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt . 
0 if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet .

1 the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
0 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
1 returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
0 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
0 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .

1 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
1 be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . 
1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' .

1 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
0 [a] crushing disappointment . 
0 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
0 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
0 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
0 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .

1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
1 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .

0 phoned-in business as usual . 
1 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
0 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
1 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .

1 unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . 
1 this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
0 a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
1  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
1 hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
0 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
0 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
0 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
0 the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
1 intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .

0 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
0 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
0 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion . 
0 gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
0 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .

0 it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
0 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
1 if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
0 never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
1 the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
1 eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 
1 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
0 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
0 it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
1 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
0 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
1 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .

0 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
0 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
1 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters .

1 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it . 
0 the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
0 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .

0 the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
0 interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
1 a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
0 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
1 if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
0 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
0 the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
0 a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
1 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
0 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
1 the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
0 with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
1 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
0  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
0 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .

0 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
0 how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
1 streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , " big trouble " is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter . 
0 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
1 a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
0 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
1 merci pour le movie . 
0 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
0 the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
1 campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
1 [gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
1 it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
1 gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script .

0 basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
0 there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .

0 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
1 the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
0 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
1 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
1 you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week .

0 nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
1 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
0 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
0 costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
1 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films .

0 sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
0 a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
0 a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
1 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .

1 eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
0 a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
0 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .

1 it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
0 woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
0 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
1 bon apptit ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies  from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation . 
0 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .

0 whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
0 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .

1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
1 a weird and wonderful comedy . 
1 it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
0 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
1 unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france . 
1 a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
0 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .

1 morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
0 there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
0 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
0 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
0 the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
1 every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
0 a quaint , romanticized rendering . 
0 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
1 nice piece of work . 
1 while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
1 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
1 it is a likable story , told with competence . 
1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
0 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
0 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely .

0 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread . 
0 overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
0 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
0 the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
0 starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichs .

1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
1 everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
0 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
1 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
1 like the best 60 minutes expos , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
0 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
1 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
0 deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
1 a conventional but heartwarming tale . 
0 the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
0 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
0 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
1 evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn . 
0 deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
0 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
0 it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
1 a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script . 
0 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
1 a very charming and funny movie . 
0 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
1 a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours . 
1 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
0 it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
1 an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world . 
0 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
0 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
1 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
1 in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better . 
0 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
0 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
0 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
0 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
0 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
1 i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
1 compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
1 the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
0 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
0 this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
0  . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
0 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
1 this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
0 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
1 a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
0 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
0 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
1 dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
1 a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
0 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
0 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
1 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
0 mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
1 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
1 this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
0 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
0 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
1 sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
1 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
1 an unflinching look at the world's dispossessed . 
1 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
0 a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
1 like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
1 may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
0 seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
0 it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
1 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation . 
1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
0 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
0 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
0 how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
1 an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
0 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
1 what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
0 little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
0 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
0 solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
0 it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
1 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
0 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
0 it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
0 bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
1 there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . 
0 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
0 just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
0 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
1 really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
0 it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
1 wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror . 
0 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
0 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
0 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
1 witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
0 a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
1 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
0 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
0 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
0 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
0 chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
1 katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
1 even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there's something vital about the movie . 
1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
0 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
1 awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful
1 jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
0 an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
1 it's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
1 an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works . 
0 a lame comedy . 
0 the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
1 there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
1 tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script . 
0 with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
0 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
1 obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
0 the chocolate factory without charlie . 
0 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
0 [crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
0 wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
1 shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
0 you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
1 sparse but oddly compelling . 
0 the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
0 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
0 the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
1  " brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
0 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
1 an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
0 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise !
