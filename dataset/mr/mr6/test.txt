0 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
0 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
1 to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
0 her film is like a beautiful food entre that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
1 even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth . 
1 an original little film about one young woman's education . 
1 great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
0 a listless and desultory affair . 
0 it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
1 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
0 just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
0 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
1 it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
0 a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
0 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
0 would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
0 though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
0 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
0 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
0  . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
1 spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
0 some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
0 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
0 in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
0 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
1 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . 
1 brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
0 everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
0 though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
1 the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
0 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
0 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
0 never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
1 for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
1 samuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process . 
0 i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
1 as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
1 the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
0 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
0 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
1 i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
1 a modestly surprising movie . 
1 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
0 demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
1 director paul cox's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
1 [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
0 vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
0 its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
0 a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
1 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
0 the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
1 one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
1 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
1 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
1 much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . 
0 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
0 though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
1 [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
0 best described as i know what you did last winter . 
1 as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan . 
1  . . . less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror . 
0 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
0 an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
0 one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
0 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
1 it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
0 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
0 sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
1 sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
1 the gags are often a stitch . 
0 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
0 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
0 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
0 the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
0 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies . 
1 an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
1 solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
1 combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption . 
0 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
0 bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
1 although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
1 she may not be real , but the laughs are . 
0 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
0 sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
0 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
1 there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .

1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
1 the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
0 it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
1 blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . 
0 to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
0 very stupid and annoying . 
0 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
1 australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
0 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
1 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
1 you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
0 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
0 the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
0 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
0 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
0 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
0 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
0 leaks treacle from every pore . 
1 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 
1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
0 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
0 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
1 what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance . 
1 it's the sweet cinderella story that " pretty woman " wanted to be . 
1 oddly compelling . 
1 a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
0 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
1 it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
1 it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids . 
0 kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
0 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
0 the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
0 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
0 one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
0 disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
0 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
0 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
1 a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
1 playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
0 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
1 blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 
0 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
0 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
1 renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else .

0 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
0 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
0 a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
1 a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
1 a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . 
1 it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
1 me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
0 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
1 it's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
0 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
1 fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing . 
0 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
1 ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
0 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
0 what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
0 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
1 a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 
0 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
1 an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
1 nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
0 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
1 it's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal . 
1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
1 not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
0  . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
0 every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
1 moving and vibrant . 
0 there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
0 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
1 it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
1 does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
0 it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
1 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
0 it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
1 there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
0 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
0  . . . unbearably lame . 
1 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
0 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
1 what i saw , i enjoyed . 
1 weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
1 about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
1 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
1 it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
0 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
0 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
1 the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
1 one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised . 
0 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
0 a grating , emaciated flick . 
1 not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
0 sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
0 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
0 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
0 can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
0 [seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
1 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
0 [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
1 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
0 the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
0 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
1 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
0 while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
0 lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
0 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
0 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
1 ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
0 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
1 an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
0 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
1  . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
0 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
1 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
1 if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
0 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
1 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
1 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
1 an asian neo-realist treasure . 
1 feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
1 plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
1 the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . 
1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
1 leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
0 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
0 yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
1 it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
1 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
0 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
1 a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
1 secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
1 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
0 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
1 this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
1 the script is smart , not cloying . 
0 they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
1 one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
0 far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
1 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
0 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
1 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
1 all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
0 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
1 kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
0 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .

0 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
1 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
0 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
1 the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics .

0 it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
0 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
1 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
1 a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
1 a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
0 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
0 the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
0 has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . .

0 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
1 a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .

1 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
1 another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
1 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .

0 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
1 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
1 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
0 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
0 neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
0 shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
0 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
1 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
0 blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
1 it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
0 technically and artistically inept . 
1 it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
0 mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
1 a pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
1 those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
1 the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
0 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
1 feardotcom's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 
0 fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
1 when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
0 a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
0 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
1 a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
1 although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
0 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
0 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
1 for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .

1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
1 audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
1 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
0 anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
1 i couldn't recommend this film more . 
0 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .

0 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
0 it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
0 it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
1 mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
1 despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . 
1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
1 the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
0 this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
0 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
1 the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .

0 one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .

1 fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
0 time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
1 a charming but slight comedy . 
0 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
1 features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film .

1 secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
0 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
1 it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie . 
1 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
1 amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . 
0 the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
0 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .

1 one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
0 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
0 the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours .

0 it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
1 an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
0 an often unfunny romp . 
0 wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
1 impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
1 [raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see . 
0 the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .

1 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
0 suffers from a flat script and a low budget .

0 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
0 entertaining enough , but nothing new
0 its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .

0 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
0 a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .

1 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
0 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
0 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
1 there is greatness here . 
1 the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
0 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
0 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
0 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
0 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
1 brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results . 
1 a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy . 
0 lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
0 be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
1 with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 
1 with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
1 a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . 
1 for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
0 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
0 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
0 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
1 the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
0 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
1 this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive . 
1 fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . 
1 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
0 eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
0 the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
0 murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
0 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
0 schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
0 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
0 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
0 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
1 while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . 
0 nothing about this movie works . 
1 nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
1 an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
0 elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
1 if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
0 like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
0 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
0 go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
0 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
1 stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
1 henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
0 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
0 russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
0 are monsters born , or made ? 
0 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
0 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
1 deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance . 
0 finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
1 worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
0 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
0 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
1 visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
0 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
0 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
0 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
1 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
1 fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
0 an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
1 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture . 
0 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
0 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
0 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
0 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
0 stay away . far away . 
0 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
0 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
1 all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
1 good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
1 with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism . 
0 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
1 we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher . 
1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
0 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
0 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
0 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
1 a fun ride . 
1 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
1 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
0 sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
0 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
1 as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
1 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
1 for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
1 nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . 
1 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere . 
0 the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
0 after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
0 a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
1 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films . 
1 lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
1 offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
0 the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
0 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
0 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .

0 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
0 a timid , soggy near miss . 
1 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
0  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
1 captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
0 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
0 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
1 each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man . 
1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
0 a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
1 hardly a film that comes along every day . 
0 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
0 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
0 the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
0 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
1 is truth stranger than fiction ? in [screenwriter] charlie kaufman's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking . 
0 what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
0 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
0 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
0 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
0 no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
1 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . 
0 its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
0 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
1 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . 
1 one of the best movies of the year . 
0 the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
1 an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel's xxx flex-a-thon . 
1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
0 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
0 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
0 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
1 highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting . 
1 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . 
1 captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted " other . " 
0 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
0 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
0 a half-assed film . 
1 a winning and wildly fascinating work . 
0 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
0 this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
0 its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
0 the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
1 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
0 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
1 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
1 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 
1 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
0 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
0 lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
0 frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
1 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
1 the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
0 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
0 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
0 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
1 you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason . 
1 a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .

0 that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
0 abysmally pathetic
1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .

0 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
1 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
0 although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
0 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
0 with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
1 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
0 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
0 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
0 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
1 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
0 return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
0 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .

1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date . 
1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
0  . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
0 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
0 what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
0 the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
0 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
1 bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness .

0 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
1 to get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr . freud . 
1 sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
0 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
0 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
1 although what time offers tsai's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 
1 it's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form . 
1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
0 definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
