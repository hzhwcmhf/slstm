0 [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
0 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

1 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
0 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
0 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
0 circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
0 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .

0 a processed comedy chop suey . 
0 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
1 it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
0 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
0 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
0 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
1 the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine

0 no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
0 a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
0 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
1 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass .

1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
1 has its share of arresting images . 
1 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
0 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .

1 meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
0 the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
0 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
0 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
0 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
1 one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
0 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
0 [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
1 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
0 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
1 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
1 the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
0 it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
1 a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
0 the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
1 a chick flick for guys . 
1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
0 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
0 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
1  . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
1  . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
1  . . . fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
0 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
1 the film oozes craft . 
0 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
1 as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
0 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
1 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
0 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
1 if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
0 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
0 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
0 it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
0 it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
1 directed with purpose and finesse by england's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
1 morvern rocks . 
0 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
1 sweet and memorable film . 
0 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
1 as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
0 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
0 no way i can believe this load of junk . 
0 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
0 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
0 benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
1 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 
0 a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
0 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
1 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan jos campanella's reputation in the united states . 
1 flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
0 an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
0 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
1 stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination . 
1 deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
0 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
0 there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
0 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
1 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone . 
1 darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
0 no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
0 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
1 hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
0 it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
0 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
0 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
0 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
0 mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
0 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1 it never fails to engage us . 
1 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
1 though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
0 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
0 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
1 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
1 as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
1 it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
0 we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
0 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
1 the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
0 only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
0 a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
0 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
0 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
0 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
1 a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it . 
1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
0 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
0 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
0 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
1 one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
1 that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
1 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
0 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
0 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
1 with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of " his girl friday , " maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . 
0 mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
0 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
0 the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
0 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
1 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
1 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
1 the film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality . 
1 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
0 nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
1 if " lilo & stitch " isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since " dumbo " certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
0 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
1 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
0 this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished .

0 the comedy is nonexistent . 
1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
1 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
0 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
1 gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested . 
1  . . . one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i've seen in quite a long time . 
1 there's an energy to y tu mam tambin . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
0 most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . 
0 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
1 berling and bart . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters . 
1 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
1 yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it .

1 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . 
0 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
0 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
0 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
0 aggravating and tedious . 
1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
0 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
0 it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
0 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
1 it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
1 it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .

0 cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
0 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
1 [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
0 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .

0 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
0 a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .

1  . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
0 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
0 it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
1 it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . 
0 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material .

0 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
0 if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
0 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .

0 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
1 in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue . 
1 an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief . 
0 the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
0 it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
1 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
1 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
0 burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .

0 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
1 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it . 
0  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
0 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
1 that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture

0 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
0 the film is strictly routine .

1 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
1 slight but enjoyable documentary . 
0 i hated every minute of it . 
0 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
1 sparse but oddly compelling . 
0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
1 harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
0 it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
0 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
1 this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
1 a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat . 
1 a wildly funny prison caper . 
1 if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .

0 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
0 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
0 according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
1 tailored to entertain ! 
0 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
0 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
1 meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
0 brisk hack job . 
1 an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 
1 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 
0 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
0 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
0  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
0 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .

0 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
1 a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
1 a compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother's hold over her . 
1 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . 
0 it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
0 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
0 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
0 impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
0 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
1 while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
1 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
0 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
0 deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .

0 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
0 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
1 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
1 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale  as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
0 death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again .

1 once you get into its rhythm . . . the movie becomes a heady experience . 
1 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
0 plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
1 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
0 the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
1 a slick , skillful little horror film . 
1 [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
1 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
1 if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you . 
1 the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
0 ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
0 when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .

0 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
1 the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
0 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
1 oddly , the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
0 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
0 the characters are based on stock clichs , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
0 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
0 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
0 this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
0 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
1  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
0 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
0 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
0 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
1 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
1 surprisingly insightful
1 touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
1 a joyous occasion
1 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is
0 cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
1 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . 
0 [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
0 though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation . 
0 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
0 filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
1 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
1 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
1 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
0 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
0 it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
1 the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
1 best indie of the year , so far . 
0 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
0 a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
0 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
1 happily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . 
0 about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
0 every note rings false . 
1 it may not be history  but then again , what if it is ?  but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
0 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
1 entertains by providing good , lively company . 
1 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
0 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
1 perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest . 
0 doesn't add up to much . 
1 don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . 
1 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
0 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
0 chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
1 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
0 more precious than perspicacious
1 drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
1 the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
1 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
1 the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
1 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
0 well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
0 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
0 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
0 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
0 what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
