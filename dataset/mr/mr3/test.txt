1 on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
1 it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
1 a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . 
0 the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
1 a witty , whimsical feature debut . 
0 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
0 well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
0 the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .

1 a three-hour cinema master class . 
1 informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms . 
1 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
0 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
1 lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . 
1 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
1 the pianist is polanski's best film . 
0 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
0 plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
1 it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
1 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 
0 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
0 it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
1 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
1 stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
1 top-notch action powers this romantic drama .

1 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey . 
1 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
0 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
1 a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
0 this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
0 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
0 a workshop mentality prevails . 
1 with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
0 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
0 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
1 it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
0 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .

0 it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
1 the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
0 the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
0 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .

0 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
1 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
0 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
0 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
1 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
0 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
1 though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .

0 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
1 wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 
1 a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity . 
0 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb .

1 psychologically revealing . 
1 the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
1 a smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy . 
1 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
0 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
1 strange it is , but delightfully so . 
0 puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
0 more maudlin than sharp . 
0 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
0 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
0 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
0 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
1 e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
1 that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
0 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
0 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
1 with the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors , eight legged freaks is prime escapist fare . 
0 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .

1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
0 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
0 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
1 as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
1 it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
1 the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
0 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
1 real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
1 not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
1 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .

1 a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch . 
1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
1 stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
1 [there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
0 its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
0 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well .

0 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
0 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
0 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
1 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work . 
1 it is definitely worth seeing . 
0 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
0 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh .

0 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
0 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
0 not exactly the bees knees
0 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
0 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
0 i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
0 it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
1 one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead . 
1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
1 a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy . 
0 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
1 an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
1 a quiet , disquieting triumph . 
1 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again . 
0 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
0 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
0 serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
0 there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
0 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
0 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
1 a no-holds-barred cinematic treat . 
1 the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful . 
0 with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
1 one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers . 
0 the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
1 both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving .

0 there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
0 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .

1 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 
0 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . .

1 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
0 when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .

1 a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
0 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
1 a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .

0 doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
0 denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
0 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
0 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
0 almost gags on its own gore . 
1 steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens--especially the a * * holes . 
1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
0 a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
1  . . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology . 
0 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
0 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
0 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
0 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
0 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
0 one long string of cliches . 
0 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
0 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
1 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
1 familiar but utterly delightful . 
0 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
0 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
1 eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
1 jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
0 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
1 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
0 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
0  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
0 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
0 soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
1 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . 
1 the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
1 the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
1 no , it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original , but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating . 
1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
0 do not see this film . 
0 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
1 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
0 adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
1 the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
0 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
1 the movie is well done , but slow . 
0 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
0 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
0 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
0 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
0 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
0 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
0  . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
0 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
0 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
0 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
1 a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
1 flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose's performance . 
1 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
0 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
0 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
1 the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
1 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
1 fun and nimble . 
1 the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
1 if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
0 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
1 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
1 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
0 if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
1 melodrama with a message . 
0 intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
0 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
1 writer and director otar iosseliani's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls . 
1 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
0 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
0 miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
0 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
1 a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
0 it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
0 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
0 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
0 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
1 it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion . 
0 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
0 even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
1 a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
0 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
0 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
0 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
0 what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
0 comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
0 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
0 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
0 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
0  . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
1 s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 
1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
1 it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 
0 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
0 topkapi this is not . 
1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
1 'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . '
1 it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression . 
1 much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
0 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
0 it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
0 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
0 its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
1  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
0 too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
1 leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
1 the result is more depressing than liberating , but it's never boring . 
0 it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
0 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
0 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
0 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
1 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan jos campanella's reputation in the united states . 
1 a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
0 it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
0 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
0 davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
0 tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
0 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
1 if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
1 the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
1 a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
0 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
0 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
0 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
1 a weird , arresting little ride . 
1 the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
1 the film has several strong performances . 
1 darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
0 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
1  . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
0 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
1 imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . 
0 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
0 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
1 poignant and delicately complex . 
1 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers . 
1 a slick , engrossing melodrama . 
1 tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
0 for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
1 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
1 a disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a 'bad' police shooting . 
0 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
1 evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
1 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman . 
0 whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
0 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
1 the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary . 
0 vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
1 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
1 this documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what [evans] had , lost , and got back . 
0 unwieldy contraption . 
1 en s mismo el rey len es un espectculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal . 
1 serious and thoughtful . 
1 as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
1 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
0 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community . 
0 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
0 you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
1 an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
0 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
1 family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking . 
1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
1  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
0 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
1 this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty . 
1 the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film . a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 . 
0 a noble failure . 
1 a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
0 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
1 poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
1 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
1 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
0 i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
0 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
0 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
0 from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
1 it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
0 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
0 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ? 
1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
1 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
0 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
1 you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see " simone , " and consider a dvd rental instead . 
0 scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
1 a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 
0 well , it does go on forever . 
1 a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure . 
0 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
1 would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic . 
0 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
0 stale , futile scenario . 
1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
1 a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
1 meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
0 chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
0 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
0 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
1 rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
1 imagine a scenario where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson's far side humor
1 i liked this film a lot . . . 
1  . . . the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
1 allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
0 you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
0 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
1 a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll . 
1 the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects . 
1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
1 helps to remind the first world that hiv/aids is far from being yesterday's news . 
1 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
0 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
1 an impeccable study in perversity . 
0 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
0 walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
0 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
0 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
1 a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
0 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
1 one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
1 the performances are remarkable . 
0 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
0 it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
0 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
0 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
1 the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
1 even the digressions are funny . 
0 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
0 [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
1 has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
0 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
1 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
1 despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
0  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
0 once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
0 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
0 holden caulfield did it better . 
1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
0 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
0 warmed-over hash . 
1 the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
0 fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
1 ultimately , " mib ii " succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . 
0 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
0 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth . 
1 well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
0 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
1 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
0 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
1 it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 
0 i'm just too bored to care .

1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .

1  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
0 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .

1 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
1 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
1 cho's timing is priceless . 
1 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con .

0 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
0 [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
1 like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .

0 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
1 old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship . 
0 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
0 i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
0 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .

1 lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy . 
0 while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
0 too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
0 not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
1 the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller .

0 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
1 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
0 it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
0 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
0 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .

0 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
1 the search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters' suffering . 
1 [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
1 i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed .

0 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
0 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
0 it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
1  . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
1 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . 
1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
1 the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
0 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
0 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
0 portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
0 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
0 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
0 does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
1 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
1 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
1 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 
0  . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
0 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
1 ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
0 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
0 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
1 perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
1 sweet and memorable film . 
1 in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition
1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
0 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
0 bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
0 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
1  " it's all about the image . " 
0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
1 what makes the movie work  to an admittedly limited extent  is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
1 an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance . 
1 charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
1 it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
0 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
0 hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
0 at once half-baked and overheated . 
0 the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
1 [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
0 late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet . 
1 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
0 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
0 on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
0 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
1 duvall is strong as always . 
0 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
0 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
1 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
0 prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
1 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension .

1 an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
1 a creaky staircase gothic . 
0 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
0 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
0 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
1 vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all . 
0 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
0 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
0 my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
0 delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
1 simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
0 to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
0 pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
0 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive .

0 there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
0 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
0 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
0 this is nothing but familiar territory . 
0 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
1 the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
0 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
0 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
1 what eric schaeffer has accomplished with never again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary . but it's defiantly and delightfully against the grain . 
1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
0 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
1 highly watchable stuff . 
1 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
1 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema .

1 a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002's first great film
0 there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
0 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
0 a puzzling experience . 
1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
1 a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama . 
1 a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid . 
0 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
0 i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
1  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
1 nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
1 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
1 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
0 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
1 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
1 though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves . 
1 sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 
0 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
0 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
1 it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
0 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
0 the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
1 an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music . 
0 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
0 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
1 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth . 
0 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
0 the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
1 a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
0 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
0 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
0 just not campy enough
0 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
1 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
0 as vulgar as it is banal . 
1 the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
1 frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
1 there's no reason to miss interview with the assassin
1 elegant , mannered and teasing . 
1 it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp ! 
1  . . . begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot . 
1 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
0 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
1 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
0 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
0 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
1 mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
0 the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
0 while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
0 anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
1 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
0 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
0 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
1 a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives . 
0 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
1 the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
0 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
1 clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises  but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
0 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
0 this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
1 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
0 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
1 an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
0 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
0 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
0 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
1 writer/director alexander payne ( election ) and his co-writer jim taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing . 
0 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
1 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .

0 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
0 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
0 a sometimes tedious film . 
1 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
1 rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker . 
0  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
1 this is not a retread of " dead poets' society . " 
0 a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
1 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
0 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
1 the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
1 a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry . 
1 there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . 
0 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
1 this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
1 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
0 if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
1 os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman so complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
0 it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
1 funny and touching . 
0 it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .

0 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
1 it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
0 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
0 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
0 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
0 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
0 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
1 it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
1 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
0 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
0 although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
0 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
0 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
0 there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .
