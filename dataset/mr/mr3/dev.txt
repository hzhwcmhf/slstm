0 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
1 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close .

0 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
0 it tells more than it shows . 
1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
1 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
0 a half-assed film . 
0 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter .

0 not once does it come close to being exciting .

1 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
1 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . 
1 in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .

1 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
0 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
1 writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
0 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '

0 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .

1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
1 steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
0 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
0 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
0 lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .

1 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .

1 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 
1 it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . 
1 its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . 
0 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
0 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters .

0 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
1 it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . 
1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
1 both deeply weird and charmingly dear . 
1 schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
1 the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
0 murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
0 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
0 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
1 transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
1 confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
1 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching . 
0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
0 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
0 the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
1 neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
1 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
0 clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
1 lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
1 moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
1 [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
1 proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
1 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
0 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective .

1 [a] superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene's 1955 novel . 
0 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
1 one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . 
0 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
0 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .

0 donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
1 formuliac , but fun . 
1 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
0 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
0 watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
0 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
0 dramatically lackluster . 
1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
1 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
0 may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
1 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
1 where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
0 simplistic , silly and tedious . 
1 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
1 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
1 although i didn't hate this one , it's not very good either . it can be safely recommended as a video/dvd babysitter . 
1  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 
0 the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
0 all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
1 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . 
1 the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages .

1 a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
0 it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
0 typical anim , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
1 apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . 
0 the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
0 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
0 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
0 a bit too eager to please . 
1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
1 smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers . 
0 largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
0 never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
0 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
1 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
1 recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion . 
0 limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
0 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
0 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .

0 the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
1 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . 
0 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
0 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
0 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
1 a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
0 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
0 there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
0 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
0 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic .

1 more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
1 it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
1  " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see . 
0 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
1 an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
0  . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
1 if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
0 during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
0 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
0 nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
1 it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
0 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
1 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
0 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
0 what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
0 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichs , depression and bad alternative music . 
1 daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story

0 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
1 not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached . 
0 i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
0 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
1 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
1 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures .

0 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
1 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 
0 this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
0 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
0 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
1  . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
1 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .

0 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
0 deserving of its critical backlash and more .

1 a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass .

1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
0 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .

0 a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
0 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
1  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time .
