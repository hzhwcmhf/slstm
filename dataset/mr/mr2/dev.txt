1 the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next .

1 what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
0 even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
0 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
0 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .

0 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
1 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works .

0 nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .

0 this is really just another genre picture . 
0 'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates .

1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .

0 as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
0 a listless and desultory affair .

0  . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats .

0  . . . unbearably lame . 
0 lacks depth . 
0 as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
0 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
0 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
0 a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
0 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
0 too simple for its own good . 
0 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
0 there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
0 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games .

0 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
0 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
0 it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
1 very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both . 
0 none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
0 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
0 predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
0 from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
1 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
0 it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
0 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
0 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
0 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
0 snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
1 a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
0 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
0 that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .

1 i liked this film a lot . . . 
0 not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
1 featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
0 dramatically lackluster . 
0 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
0 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .

1 the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
0 cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .

0 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
0 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .

0 there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
1 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .

0 this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
0 there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
0 somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
0 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

0 what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .

1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
1 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .

1 beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people .

1 at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 
1 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it .

1 pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years . 
0 a negligible british comedy . 
0 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .

0 been there done that . 
0 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .

0 too clever by about nine-tenths . 
1 a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events .

0 real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
1 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
1 will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
0 crummy
0 ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
0  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
0 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
1 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
1 skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . 
0 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
0 no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuao , harold ramis deve ter sado da cama com o p esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme tambm . 
1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .

0 if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
0 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
0 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .

1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive .
