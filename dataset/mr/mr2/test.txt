0 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
0 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
0 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point .

1 the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
1 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life . 
0 it's splash without the jokes . 
0 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
1 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
1 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet . 
1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
0  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
1 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
0 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
0 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
0 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
1 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
0 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
0 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
1 it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 
1 a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession . 
1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
1 two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
0  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
0 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
0 the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
1 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments . 
0 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
0 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
0 there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
1 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
0 this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
1 in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
0 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
0 completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
1 i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
1 a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution . 
1 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance .

0 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
0 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
1  . . . a true delight . 
0 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
1 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
1 an effectively creepy , fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . 
1 not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
1 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .

1 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . 
0 just one bad idea after another .

0 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
0 doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
0 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
0 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
0 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
0 the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .

1 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . 
1 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . 
1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
1  . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
0 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
1 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
0 granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
0 full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
0 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
0 once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
0 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
0 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
0 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
1 if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film . 
0  . . . stale and uninspired . 
1 what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
1 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
1 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
0 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
1 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
1 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
0 this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
0 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
1 candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
1 allen's funniest and most likeable movie in years . 
0 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
0 mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
0 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
1 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . 
0 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
0 the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
0 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
1 i just loved every minute of this film . 
0 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
0 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
0 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
0 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects . 
0 worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
1 a smart , witty follow-up . 
0 it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
1 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . 
0 in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
0 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
0 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
1 the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh . 
0 a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
1 more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original . 
0 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
0 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
0 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
1 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
0 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
0 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
0 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
0 as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
0 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
0  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
1  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
1 an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart . 
1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
1 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
0 it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
0 the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
1 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
1 the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh's three lead actresses . 
1 [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
1 if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be . 
0 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
0 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
0 indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
0 a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
0 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
0 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
1 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
0 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
1 one from the heart . 
0 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
1 jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
1 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
0 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
0 though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
0 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
1 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . 
0 despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
0 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
1 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran . 
0 while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
0 van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
0 the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
1 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
0 it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
0 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
1 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
1 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
0 on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
1 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other . 
0 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
0  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
1 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
0 the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
1 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
0 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
1 even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
0 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking . 
1 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
0 boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
1 looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . 
0  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
0 both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
0 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
1 manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
0 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
1 i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
0 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
0 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
1 allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
1 may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
0 a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
0 too much of the humor falls flat . 
1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
0 it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
1 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection . 
1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
1 it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
1 leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
1 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
1 so unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! '
1 one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . 
0 like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz . 
0 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
1 deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
1 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . 
0 can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
1 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not . 
0 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
0 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
0 no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
0 overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
1  . . . a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno . 
1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
0 simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
1 an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
0 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
0 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
0 the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
0 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
1 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
1 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
1 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
0 it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
0 the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
1 maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . 
1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
1 one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
0 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
1 a deep and meaningful film . 
0 director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
0 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
0 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
1 it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
1 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . 
0 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
1 the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides . . . [and] personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
0 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
0 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
1 the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . 
0 you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
1 the subtle strength of " elling " is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . 
1 [t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
1 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
0 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
1 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
0 the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
0 kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
1 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down . 
0 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
1 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
1 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
1 the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
0 there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
0 nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
1 the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
0 it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
1 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake . 
0 slick piece of cross-promotion . 
0 this is a truly , truly bad movie .

1 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
0 utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
1 a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time .

1 'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
0 as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
1 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
0 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

1 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
1 if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .

0  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
0 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
1 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
1 it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
0 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
0 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
1 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
1 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women .

1 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . 
1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .

0 the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
0 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
1 more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .

1 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .

1 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
1 [a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
0 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .

0 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
0 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
1 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get .
