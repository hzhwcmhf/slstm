1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
0 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
0 cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
0 if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
0 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
1 lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . 
1 an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
0 a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
0 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
1 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
0 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
0 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
0 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
0 an extremely unpleasant film . 
0 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
0 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
0 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
0 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
1 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
1 it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout . 
0 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
0 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
0 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
0 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
0 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
1 darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
0 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
1 proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
1 witty , touching and well paced . 
1 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood . 
1 maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
0 britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
1 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
1 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
1 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
0 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
1 it's a treat  a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
0 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
0 there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
0 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
0 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
0 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
0 scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
1 a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
1 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
1 it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
0 releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
1 the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
0 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
0 a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
0 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
0 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
1 broomfield turns his distinctive 'blundering' style into something that could really help clear up the case . 
0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
0 a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
0 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
0 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
1 what's so striking about jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
0 disjointed parody . 
1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
0 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
1 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
0 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
0 tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
1 cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . 
1 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre . 
0 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
0 report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
1 the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way . 
1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
0 the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
0 narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
1 compellingly watchable . 
0 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
1 os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman so complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
0 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
1 ms . seigner and mr . serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters . 
1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
1 the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent . 
0 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
1 a smart , witty follow-up . 
1 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture . 
1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
0 the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth . 
0 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
1 lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
0 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
0 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
0 barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
0 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
1 don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
1 captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted " other . " 
0 both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
0 the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
0 like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
0 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
0 the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
0 the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 
1 the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
1 it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
0 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
1 director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see . 
1 a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet . 
0 though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich . 
0 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
0 almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
0  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
1  " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
0 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
0 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
1 what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
0 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
1 a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them . 
1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
0 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
0 a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
0 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
0 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
1 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
0 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
0 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
0 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
0 a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
0 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
1 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
1 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
0 its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
1 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
1 the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
0 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
1 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
1 the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
0 [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
1 as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
1 a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
0 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
0 i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
0 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
0 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
0 ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
1 the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
1 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
1 it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
0 ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
0 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
1 just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer . 
0 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
0 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
0 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
1 a quiet , pure , elliptical film
0 an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
0 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
0 don't waste your money . 
0 it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
1 works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
1 clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . . 
0 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
1 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . . 
1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
0 director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
0 predictably melodramatic . 
0 what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
1 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
0 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
0 the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
0 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
0 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
0 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
1 ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . 
1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
0 an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
0 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
0 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
0 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
0 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
0 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
1 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
0 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
1 much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
0 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
1 the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
0 just a bloody mess . 
0 guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
0 normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
0 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
0 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
0 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
0 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
1 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
0 philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
1 adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
1 like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
1 wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror . 
1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
0 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
1 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
0 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
0 with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
1 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 
1 the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . 
1 there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 
0 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
1 it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
1 good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
0 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
0 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
0 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
0 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
0 the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
0 simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread . 
0 shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
1 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
0 naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
1 simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
1 pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
0 dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
0 meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
1 frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
0 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
0 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
0 in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
0 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
1 rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie . 
1 while guzmn frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable . 
0 overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
0 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
1 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 
1 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .

0 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts .

0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
0 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
0 the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
1 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
1 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids .

1 witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
1 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them . 
0 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
1 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
1 it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up .

0 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .

0 you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
0 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
1 schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
0 it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
0 too slow , too long and too little happens . 
0 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
0 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .

0 looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .

1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .

1 it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty .

1 hilarious , acidic brit comedy . 
1 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
1 it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight .

0 slap me , i saw this movie . 
0 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
0 the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john .

1 a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
1 its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .

0 what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
1 as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 
0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves

0 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
0 while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
1 an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
0 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
0  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
0 no way i can believe this load of junk .

0 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
0 feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part .

1 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
1 there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
1 arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
0 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
1 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama . 
1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
1 hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
1  . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
0 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
0 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
0 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
0 it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us .

0 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
1 [haynes'] homage to such films as " all that heaven allows " and " imitation of life " transcends them . simply put , " far from heaven " is a masterpiece . 
1 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity . 
0 a little too pat for its own good . 
1 smart and taut . 
0 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .

0 the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
1 starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
0 snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
1 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
1 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
0 passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .

1 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 
0 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .

1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment .

1 [ns] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
1 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .

0 disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
1 famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich-riddled genre can offer .

1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
1 when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year .

0 the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
1 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
0 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
1 it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
1 that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
1 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias romnticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
0 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
1 it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
1 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true . 
1 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm

1 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons . 
0 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
0 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
0 ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
0 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
0 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
1  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
0 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .

1 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
0 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
0  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks .
