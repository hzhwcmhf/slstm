0 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
0 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .

1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
0 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
0 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
0 despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .

0 there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
0 can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .

0 if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
1 there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
0 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 .

1 i've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we've got something pretty damn close .
