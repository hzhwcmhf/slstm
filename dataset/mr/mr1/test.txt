1 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
1 this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters . 
1 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
0 the characters are based on stock clichs , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
1 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
1 whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria . 
0 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .

0 the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
0 dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .

1 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . 
1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
0 the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
1 the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
1 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
0 a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .

1 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
0 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .

1 good ol' urban legend stuff . 
0 those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
1 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying .

1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
0 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them .

0 director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
0 shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .

1 no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing . 
0 one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . .

0 the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
0 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . 
0 mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
0 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
1 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
1 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street . 
1 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
1 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption . 
0 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
1  . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
0 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life .

1 a wildly funny prison caper . 
1 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop . 
1 has a plot full of twists upon knots . . . and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill . 
1 it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 
0 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
0 naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
0 it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
0  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do .

0 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
1 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind . 
1 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
1 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
0 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
1 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '

1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
0 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
0 what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
0 the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
1 it's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice . 
1 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 
0 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .

0 everyone's to blame here . 
1  . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around )
