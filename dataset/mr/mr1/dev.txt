0 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
0 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich .

0 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either .

0 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
0 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
1 an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
0 the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
0 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
1 enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast . 
0 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
1 cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
0 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
0 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
0 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
1 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
0 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
1 although it doesn't always hang together -- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- " cherish " certainly isn't dull . 
0 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .

1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
0 sluggish , tonally uneven . 
1 although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime . 
1 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . 
0 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
0 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
1 a lovely film for the holiday season . 
1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
1 it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . 
0 schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
0 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous .

0 it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichs the filmmakers could dredge up . 
0 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
1 mr . clooney , mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster .

0 its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
1 not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
0 i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
0 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
0 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
1 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
0 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
0 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
1 the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
1 what's so striking about jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
1 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 
0 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
0 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
0 a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .

1 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
1 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis .

1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective . 
0 one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
0 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
0 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .

0 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '

1 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .

0 frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes .

1 there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .

0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
1 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .

1 grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
0 you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
0 a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
1 less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) . 
1 an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
0 aan opportunity wasted . 
1 maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
0 with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
0 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
0 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
0 the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
0 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .

1 a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
0 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
1 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
0 the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
1 painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .

1  " me without you " is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades . 
0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
0 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
0 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
0 scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
1 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
1 me without you has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood .

1 intimate and panoramic . 
1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
0 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
0 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
1 a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . 
0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
1 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
0 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
0 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
1 this is one of the year's best films . 
0  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
0 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
1 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
0 a very average science fiction film . 
0 this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .

0 if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
1 the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
0 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
0 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
1 bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
0 the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love .

1 spare but quietly effective retelling . 
1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
0 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
0 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
1 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
1 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
0 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
1 the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . 
0 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
0 the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
0 cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
1 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
0 feeble comedy .

1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
0 one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
0 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
1 this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated . 
0 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
0 schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .

0 routine and rather silly . 
1 it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 
0 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
0 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
1 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
1 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
1 it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
0 a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .

1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking . 
1 the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
0 maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
1 jackson is always watchable . 
0 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
1 the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
1 if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
0 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
1 a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
1 for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
0 the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
1 a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold .

0 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
1 if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept .

0 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
0 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
0 it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
1 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
0 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
0 i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible !

0 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead .

1 an impressive hybrid . 
1 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
0 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
1 parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
1 you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 
1 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
0 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
0 as social expos , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
0 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
1 brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
0 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
1 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end .

0 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career .

0 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .

0 parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
1 it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
1 it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
1 a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
0 paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
0 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
1 every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . 
1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
0 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
0 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
0 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
0 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
0 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
0 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
0 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
0 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
0 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
0 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
1 the script is smart , not cloying . 
0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
1 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
0 ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
0 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
1 a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script . 
1 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
0 while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
0 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
1 like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
1 the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but  in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has  ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
0 our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
0 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
0 bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
1 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
0 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
0 something must have been lost in the translation . 
0 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
0 long time dead ? not nearly long enough . 
0 there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
0 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
1 you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . 
0 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
1 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
0 if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
1 for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half . 
1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
0 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
0  . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
0 if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
1 jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair . 
1 as part of mr . dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . 
1 visually captivating . 
0 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
1  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
0 showtime is closer to slowtime . 
1 thoroughly enjoyable . 
1 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
0 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
0 the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
1 superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintar's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
1 the performances are uniformly good . 
1 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
1 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
0 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
0 j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
1 simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
1 sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
1 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
1 as bundy , michael reilly burke ( octopus 2 : river of fear ) has just the right amount of charisma and menace . 
0 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
0 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
0 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
0 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
0 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
0 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
0 the story has little wit and no surprises . 
0 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
0 you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
0 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
1 my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
0 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
1 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
1 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
1 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
1 the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture . 
1 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
1 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
1 apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . 
0 a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
1 while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
1 the film is one of the year's best . 
0 rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
1 a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded . 
1 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
1 soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
0 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
0 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
0 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
1 vera's three actors -- moll , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances . 
0 an encouraging effort from mccrudden
1 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures . 
1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
1 can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music
0 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
0 one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
0 pompous and garbled . 
1 schtte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
1 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
1 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
0 the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
1 the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
0 responsvel direto pelo fracasso 'artstico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox no consegue sequer aproveitar os pouqussimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
1 ' . . . mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '
0 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
0 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
1 you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . 
0 though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
0 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire .
