0 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .

0 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
1 borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
0 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
0 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial .

0 a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
0 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
0 maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
0 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .

0 equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
1 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances .

0 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
0 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
1 austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
0 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story .

1 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
1 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
1 when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
1 my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
0 the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
1 hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
0 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
0 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one .

1 an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale . 
0 what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
1 reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies .

1 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
0 a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending .

1 a riveting documentary . 
0 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
0 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .

0 the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
0 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
0 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
0 the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
0 [evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .

1 director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
0 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
0  . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .

1 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
1 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy .

0 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
0 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
0 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
1 they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
1 it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
0 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
1 there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
0 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes .

0 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
0 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
0 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
0 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
0 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
0 no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
0 a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .

0 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
1 sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
1 what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
0 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .

0 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
1  . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
1 one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
1 walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment . 
1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
0 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
1 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
1 its director's most substantial feature for some time .

1 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
0 sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
1 while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
0 most of the action setups are incoherent . 
0 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
0 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
0 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
0 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
0 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
0 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
1 implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all . 
0 an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
1 a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
1  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable .

0 all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
0 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
1 foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
1 the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less . 
1 if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
1 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
0 unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
1 as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction .

0 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
0 stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
1 with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
1 [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
1 fierce , glaring and unforgettable . 
1 an elegant and sly deadpan comedy .

1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
0 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
1 she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
1 excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
1 victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . 
1 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
1 george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 
0 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
1 the delicious trimmingsarrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minutewith a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
1 despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
1 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
1 another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
0 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
1 as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 
0 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
0 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
1 vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
0 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
0  in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
0 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
0 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
1 visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
1 fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
1 frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances . . . keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
0 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
0 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
1 the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
0 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
1 if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
0 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
1 the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
1 those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
0 a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
0 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
0 the central story lacks punch . 
0 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
1 the film grows on you . and how . 
1 mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek . 
0 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .

1 roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . 
0 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
1 transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
0 it's an awfully derivative story . 
0 true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
0 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
1 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
1 the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
1 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
1 the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
0 painfully padded .

0 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
1 as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
0 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
0 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary .

1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
0 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
0 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
1 'what's the russian word for wow ! ? '
0 it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .

0 dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
0  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
1 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
1 intimate and panoramic . 
1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance .

1 intelligent and moving . 
1 schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
0 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
1 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
0 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
0 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .

1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
1 in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
0 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
0 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
1 bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time . 
1 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
1 blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 
0 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
1 neatly constructed thriller . 
0 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
1 a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation .

1 hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
1  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
1 jagger , stoppard and director michael apted . . . deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride . 
0 on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
0 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
1 at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
1 'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
0 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
0 [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
0 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
0 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
1 the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
0 lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
0 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
1 the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
0 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
0 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
1 a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
1  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
1 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
0 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
0 here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
1 some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain .

1 a good thriller . 
0 the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
0 though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
1 shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience .

0 martin scorsese cria um espetculo visual que no possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
0 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
0 just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
1 the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but  in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has  ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
1 it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
1 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .

0 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
0 nothing about it fits . 
0 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
0 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
0  . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
1 it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
1 this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
0 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
0 a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
1 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
0 just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .

1 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
0 this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
0 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
1 even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film .

1 it's a treat  a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
1 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute .

1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
0 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
0 it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
0 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
0 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor .

1 brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
0 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
1 provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already .

1 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '

0 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
1 robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 
1 it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
1 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering .

1 it's never dull and always looks good . 
1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
1 at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious .

0 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
0 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
0 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
0 a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
0 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
1 no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming .

0 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women .

1 twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
0 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
0 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
1 while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging . 
0 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
0 reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
0 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
1 the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
1 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle .

0 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
0 two-bit potboiler . 
1 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
1 a beautifully observed character piece . 
1 what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight

0 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
1 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
1 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
0 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
1 birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
1 overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love .

1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger . 
0 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintar's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
1 what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned .

1 can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music
0 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
1 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
1 in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
0 parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play .

1 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
0 at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
1 the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion . 
1 this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
0 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
1 the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
0  " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
0 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
0 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
1 it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
1 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
0 once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
1 a tone poem of transgression . 
0 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
0 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
0 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
1 although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
1 the film is full of charm . 
1 assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
0 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
0  . . . too dull to enjoy .

1 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
0 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .

0 sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
0 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
1 this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
0 a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
0 truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
1 morvern rocks . 
0 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
0 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
1 the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
1 genuinely unnerving . 
1 a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
0 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
1 demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
1 the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
1 the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
1  " white oleander , " the movie , is akin to a reader's digest condensed version of the source material . 
1 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast . 
1 daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails . 
0 flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
0 it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
0 the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
0 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
0 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
0 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
1 one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
1 a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
0 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
0 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .

0 grating and tedious .

0 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
0 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
1 this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
0 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
1 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
0  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
0 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
0 none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
0  . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
0 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
1 watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat . 
1 payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business . 
1 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
0 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
1 it's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
0 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
1 its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart . 
0 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
0 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot !

1 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
1 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough .

0 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
0 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
0 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
1 a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
0 none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
1 this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .

0 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act .

1 its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
1 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas .

1 terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
0 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
0 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
1 salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
1 gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
0 gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
1 unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity ofemotional recovery . 
0 while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
1 a slight but sweet film . 
1 ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 
1 rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film's short 90 minutes . 
1 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
0 i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
1 whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema's master craftsmen . 
1 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . 
0 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
1 the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 
1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
0 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
0 extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
0 almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
1 one of the greatest films i've ever seen . 
0 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
0 somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
1 the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
0 never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
0 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
1 in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
1 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
0 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
1 short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
1 it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 
1 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
1 i loved the look of this film . 
0 it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
1 [leigh] has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . 
0 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
1 while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
0 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
1 a compelling film . 
0 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
1 american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
0 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
0 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
1 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
0 even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
0 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
0 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
0 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
0 this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
1 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
0 when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
1 it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
0 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
0 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
0 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
1 10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
0 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
0 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
1 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
1 this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
0 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
0 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
1 credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
0 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
1 a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
0 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
0 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
0 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
0 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
1 may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
0 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
0 ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
0 a sudsy cautionary tale . 
0 [sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
1 the movie is a trove of delights . 
0 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
0 just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
0 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
1 'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
0 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
0 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
1 a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
0 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
0 the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
0 even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
1 while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting . 
0 despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
0 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
0 birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honor ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
0 a lifetime movie about men . 
0 propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
0 it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
1 tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience . 
0 it never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
0 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
1 [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
0 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . 
0 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
0 apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
1 takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer
1 this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
0 got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
1 last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . 
0 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
0 schindler's list it ain't . 
1 it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . 
0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
1 clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
0 ecks this one off your must-see list . 
1 i like this movie a lot . i like that smith , he's not making fun of these people , he's not laughing at them . 
1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
1 fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying .
