0 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .

0 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
1 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama .

1 informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms .

1 literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . 
1 [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
0 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
0 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
1 expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 
1 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .

0 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
1 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
0 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
0 diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
1 meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
0 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
0 one lousy movie . 
1 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
0 the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
0 swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
0 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
1  . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle . 
0  ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
0 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
1 conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 
1 fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
1 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
0 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
0 ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
0 the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
1 disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem . 
0 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
0 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
1 this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
1 best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man . 
1 a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
1 i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
0 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
0 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
1 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
0 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
1 provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
1 not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached . 
1 an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
1 even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
0 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
0 director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
0 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
1  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
0 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
1 led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
1 my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
1 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
1 the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
0 what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
1 elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy . 
0 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
1  . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
1 mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
0 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
1 pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel . 
1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
0 bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
0 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
1 watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy . 
0 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
0 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
0 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
1 i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
1 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
0 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichs and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
0 the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
0 what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
0 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
0 not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
0 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
1  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
1 morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
0 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
0 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
0 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
0 the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
0 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
0 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open . 
0 the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
1 dense , exhilarating documentary . 
0 it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
1 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere . 
1 a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
1 lightweight but appealing . 
1 illuminating if overly talky documentary . 
0 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
0 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge .

0 the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
1 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents . 
0 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
1 it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
1 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
0 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
1 director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j . wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . 
0 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
0 so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
0 murder by numbers just doesn't add up .

1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
0 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
0 cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
0 could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
0 director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
0 if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
0 an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
0 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
1 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .

0 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised .

1 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent . 
0 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
0 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .

1  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation .

0 a dreary indulgence . 
0 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
1 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
0 it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
0 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .

1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
1 not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
0 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
0 they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
0 it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
1 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is . 
1 what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
0 this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
0 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
0 where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
0 for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one .

0 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
1 there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works . 
1 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
0 full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . 
0 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
0 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight .

0  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
1 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving .

0 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
1 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
1 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . 
0 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
0 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
1 exciting and well-paced . 
1 made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental . 
0 the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
1 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
0 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
0 shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
0 what an embarrassment . 
1 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
0 an opportunity missed . 
0 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
0 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
0 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
0 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
0 every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
0 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .

0 the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
1 the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . 
0 it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
1 it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .

1 for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
0 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
0 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
0 it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
0 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
0  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
0 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
1 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
0 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .

0  . . . too sappy for its own good . 
1 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 
1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
0 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
0 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
0 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
0 under-rehearsed and lifeless

0 those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
0 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .

0 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
0 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
0 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
0 like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
0 my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
1 well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
0 it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .

0 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
1 though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
1 you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh . 
1 a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
1 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
1 by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
1 a marvel like none you've seen . 
0 a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
1 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
1 the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams . 
0 it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
0 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
1 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 
0 this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
0 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
0 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
1 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
0 imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
1  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
0 the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
0 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
1 nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . 
0 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
1 this is art paying homage to art . 
1 the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
0 everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
0 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
0 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
0 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
0 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
0 resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
1 fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm . 
0 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
1 it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
0 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
0 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
0 madonna still can't act a lick . 
0 j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
0 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .

0 a film that loses sight of its own story . 
0 we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
0 pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
0 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .

0 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
1 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .

0 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
1 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 
0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
0 it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment .

1 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
1 it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is . 
0 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
0 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
0 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
0 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
1 sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodramticos para arrancar lgrimas do espectador , o pianista  um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante .

1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
0 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
1 romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
