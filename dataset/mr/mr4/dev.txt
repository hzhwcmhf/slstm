1 the film oozes craft . 
1 'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit

0 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
0 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
0 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
0 the chocolate factory without charlie . 
1 it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
0 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
0 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
1 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
0  . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
1 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy . 
1 it's definitely a step in the right direction . 
0 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
0 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
1 all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
0 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
0 all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .

1 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
0 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
1 those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi .

0 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
0 the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
1 a witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
1 this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 
0 supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest .

0 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
1 an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work . 
0 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
0 i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
1 a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
0 with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
1 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
0 while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
0 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
1 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
1 warm and exotic . 
0 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
0 all mood and no movie . 
1 one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . 
0 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
1 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere . 
0 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
1 i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
0 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .

0 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama .

0 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
0 this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
1 a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 
0 [denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
0 taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
0 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one .

0  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
1 hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
0 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
0  . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
0 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .

1 go see it and enjoy . 
0 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
1 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
1 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
0 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
0 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
0 the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
1 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
0 has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9  weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
1 were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
0 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
0 if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
0 it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
0 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
1 meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
1 the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
1 the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
1 it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on . 
0 comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
1 the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . 
0 in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
1 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
1 while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
1 p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
0 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
0 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
1 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth . 
1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
1 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
1 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
0 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
0 highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
1 i simply can't recommend it enough . 
0 get out your pooper-scoopers . 
0 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
1 there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
1 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
1 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
0 a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
0 sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
0 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
0 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
0 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
1 delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
0 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
0 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
1 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
0 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
1  . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
1 between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
0 a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
1 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
0 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
0 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
0 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
0 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
0 ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
0 expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
0  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
0 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
1 a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
0  sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
0 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
1 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
0 i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
1 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
1 as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
1 [fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
1 it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
0  . . . hypnotically dull . 
1 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes . 
0 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
0 this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
1 miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
0 while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
1  . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
0 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
1 the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
1 a small movie with a big impact . 
1 seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness . 
1 an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
0 there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
0 arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
1 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
1 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
0 it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
0 nothing about it fits . 
0 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
0 one of the worst films of 2002 . 
1 although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
1 it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love 'real' . 
1 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
0 not exactly the bees knees
1 offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
1 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale  as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
1 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 
1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
0 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
0 children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
1 visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
1 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
0 ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 
1 a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode . 
0 what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
1 kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
1 its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray . 
1 merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen . 
0 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
1 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
1 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
1 neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . 
0 ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
0 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
1 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
1 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
0 too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
1 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
1 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
0 beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
1 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
1 nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
1 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
1 this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are . 
0 a real snooze . 
1 aside from rohmer's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art . 
1 an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
0 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
0 no surprises . 
0 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
0 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .

1 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . 
0 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
0  . . . a pretentious mess . . . 
0 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
1 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
1 any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
1 if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
0  . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
1 wise and deadpan humorous . 
0 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou .

1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
0 what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
1 this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
0 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
1 what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . 
1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
1 twenty years after its first release , e . t . remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg's misunderstood career . 
0 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
1 although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
0  . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
0 slap me , i saw this movie . 
1 what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
0 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
1 a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives . 
1 it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 
1 less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself . 
1 spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .

0 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
0 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
0 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting .

1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
1  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point .

0 costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
1 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
0 the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
0 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
1 this amiable picture talks tough , but it's all bluster -- in the end it's as sweet as greenfingers . . . 
0 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
0 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
0 everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
0 if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't .

1 while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying . think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind . 
0 the film is strictly routine . 
0 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
1 richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess .

1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title .

1 even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
0 seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
1 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
1 jacquot's tosca is a treat . 
1 the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . 
0 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
1 what makes the movie work  to an admittedly limited extent  is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .

1 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
0 it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mtier . 
0 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
1 a perceptive , good-natured movie . 
1 witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
0 to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
0 his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
0 two-bit potboiler . 
0 it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
1 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story .

1 a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe . 
1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
0 ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
1 it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
1 a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
1 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
1 the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 
0 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
0 so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
1 it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
1 watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision . 
0 soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .

0 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable .

0 diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
1 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
1 in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
1 if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
0 bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
0 mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
1 mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek . 
0 everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
0 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
0  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .

1 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . 
0 the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .

1 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
1 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
0  is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
0 kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
0 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .

0 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
0 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
0 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .

1 the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
1 the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
0 though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
0 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
1 polished , well-structured film . 
1  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
1 a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
0 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
0 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
0 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .

1 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
0 one of the worst movies of the year . 
1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
0 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
0 on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .

0 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
0 the film's center will not hold .

1 a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
1  . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . . 
1 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
1 we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef . 
0 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .

0 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
0 you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . 
0 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
1  a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures . 
0 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
0 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
1 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . 
1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart

1 the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
0 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars

1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
1 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking .

1  " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . " 
1 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
0 i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
0 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .

1 the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
1 its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff . 
0 watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures .
