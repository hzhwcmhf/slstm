0 i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
1 a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
0 no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
1  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
1 the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
1 labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
1 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
1 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
1 confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted . 
1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
0 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
0 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
1 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
1 it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
0 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
1 filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
0 just plain silly . 
0 it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
1 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
0 whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
0 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
0 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
0 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
1 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
0 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
0 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
1 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion . 
1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
1 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
0 but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
1 offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
1 gently humorous and touching . 
0 oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
0 there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
1 a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . 
1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
1 a moving , if uneven , success . 
0 where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
0 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
0 britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
1 while guzmn frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable . 
0 little more than a frothy vanity project . 
0 the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
0 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
1 throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . 
0 when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
1  . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
0 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
1 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
0 is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
0 you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
1 [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
1 an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary . 
0 one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
0 lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
1 contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
0 do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor . 
1 touch ! 
1 think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch . 
1 catch it . . . if you can ! 
1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
1 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
0 the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
1 michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
0 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
0 you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
0 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
0 this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
1 scooby doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation . 
1 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
0 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
0 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
1 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 
1 this is a superior horror flick . 
0 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
0 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
1 going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through . 
0 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
0 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
1  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject  taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
0 it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
1 contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
1 fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten
0 this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
1 amazing ! a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
1 star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
1 less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
1 hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
1 a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
0 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
1 k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . 
0 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
0 a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
0 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
1 the komediant is a tale worth catching . 
0 it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
0  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
1 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
0  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
0 opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
0 it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
1 if anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . 
0 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
1 yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
1 return to never land is reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . 
0 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
1 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
0 a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
0 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
0 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
0 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
0 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
1 the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster . 
1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) thirdemotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
1 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
1 ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
1 surprisingly powerful and universal . 
0 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
1 pray has really done his subject justice . 
1 a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 
0 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
0 thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
1 this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
0 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
0 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
0 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
0 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
1 funny in a sick , twisted sort of way . 
0 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
0 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
0 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
1 directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . 
1 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
0 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
1 well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
1 as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 
1 the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
1 if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
1 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
1 an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
0 a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
1 triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
0 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
0 [it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
1 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
1 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
0 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
1 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
1 [sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
1 a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
0 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
1 deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
1 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
0 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
1 the performances are uniformly good . 
1 a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
0 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
1 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
0 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
1 a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
0 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
1 astonishingly skillful and moving . . . it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one . 
1 a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
1 for a movie audience , the hours doesn't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 
0 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
0 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
1 a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
1 it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains . 
1 nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
0 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
0 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
0 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
1 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
0 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
0 what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
1 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
0 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
1  . . . a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take . 
0 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
0 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
1  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
1 these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
0 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
0 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
1 a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
1 with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
0 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
0 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
0 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
0 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
1 almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
0 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
0 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
0 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
1 though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
0 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
1 it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
1  . . . is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? you bet there is and it's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking . 
0 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
1  " the best disney movie since the lion king " 
0  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
0 rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
1 makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
1 overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances . 
0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
0 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
1 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
0 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
0 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
0 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
1 the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
1 slight but enjoyable documentary . 
1 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
0 the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
0 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
1 the film is insightful about kissinger's background and history . 
0  . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
1 majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
0 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
0 so clichd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
1 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
0 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
1 the fast runner' transports the viewer into an unusual space
1 the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
1 a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 
1 toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
1 it's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
1 an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
1 it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death . 
1 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
1 a tasty masala . 
1 there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
1 a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
0 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
1 a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
0 this is really just another genre picture . 
0 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
1 hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow .

0 shallow . 
1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
1 an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
0 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
1 it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
1 refreshing . 
1 a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .

1 a riveting story well told . 
1 the results , if not memorable , are at least interesting . 
0 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
0 these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
1 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic .

1 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
1 it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
0 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
0 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
0 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .

0 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
0 some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
0 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
0 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
0 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .

0 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
0 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
1 nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
0 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
0 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
1 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
0 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
0 undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
0 doesn't amount to much of anything . 
0 the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
1 photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic . 
1 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
0 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
0 overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring .

1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
0 a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
1 the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
1 it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
1 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
1 hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
0 demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
0 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
1 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
1 some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker . 
1 a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions . 
1 a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
0 it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
0 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .

0 so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
0 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
1 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
0 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
0 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad .

0 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
0 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
0 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .

1 a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain . 
1 it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
0 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .

1 the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael .

0 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .

0 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
0 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
1 one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
0 can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .

0 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
0 the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .

1 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
0 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .

0 [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
0 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
0 i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood .

1 as part of mr . dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . 
1 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .

1 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
0 [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
0 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .

0 it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
1 like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way .

1 fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen .

1 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
1 spare yet audacious . . . 
0 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
1 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .

1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
1 though not for everyone , the guys is a somber trip worth taking . 
1 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .

0 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
0 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
0 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
0 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
0 as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
0  . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
1 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
1 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
0 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
0 [i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
0 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
1 whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
0 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
1 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
0 good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
0 focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
0 let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
0 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
0 will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
1 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
1 a jewish ww ii doc that isn't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! who knew . . . 
1 the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
1 you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh . 
0 'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
1 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
0 if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
1 thanks to the chteau's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
1  . . . wise and elegiac . . . 
0 at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
1 pretty good little movie . 
0 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
1 the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
0 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
1 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
0 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
0 so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
0 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
1 pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
0 ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
1 rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
0 collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
1  . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect , including the assumption that " crazy " people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
0 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
1 combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 
0 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
1 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
0 a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
0 a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
1 [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
0 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
1 a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . 
0  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
1 worth a look as a curiosity . 
1 the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
0 a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
0 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
1 watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
0 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
0 there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
1 this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
1 a taut , sobering film . 
1 it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
0 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
1 it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
0 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
1 a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
1 the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
1 twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down  greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe . 
1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
1 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug . 
0 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
1 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
0 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
0 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
1 it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
1 williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
0 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
0 if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
0 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
0 if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
0 the story really has no place to go since simone is not realshe can't provide any conflict . 
0 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
0 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
0 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
0 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
0 feeble comedy . 
0 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
0 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
0 a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
0 first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
1 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
0 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
0 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
1 it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
0 it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
1 remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies . 
1 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
0 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
0 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
0 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
1 highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
0 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
1 even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold . 
0 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
0 as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
1 sean penn , you owe nicolas cage an apology . 
0 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
0 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
0 it's exactly what you'd expect . 
0 kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest . 
0 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
1 visually captivating . 
0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
0  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
0 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
1 a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
1 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
0 not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
1 worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on bttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
0  . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
1 i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
0 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
0 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
1 maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is . 
0 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
1 you live the mood rather than savour the story . 
0 that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
0 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
1 from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
0 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
1 director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage . 
1 less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 . 
1 it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
1 very well-written and very well-acted . 
1 the film jolts the laughs from the audience--as if by cattle prod . 
1 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
1 at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
1 i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
1 in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
0 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
1 featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . 
1 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
0 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
0 though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
1 drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
0 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
0 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
1 the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
0 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
0 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichs and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
0 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
1 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
0 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
1 confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
1  . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . 
0 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
1 between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 
0 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
1 even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
0 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
0 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
1 at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
1 kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
1 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
0 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
1 life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . 
1 while there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it doesn't . 
0 it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
1 the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle . 
0 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
1 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
0 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
0 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
1 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 
0 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
1 the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
0 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
0 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
1 i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you . 
0 if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
0 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
0 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
0 wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
0 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
0 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
0 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
0 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
0 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
1 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
1 alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise . 
1 the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
0 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
0 denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
1 a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers . 
1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . 
0 an awful snooze . 
1 there's plenty to impress about e . t . 
1 graas s interaes entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se no apenas uma histria divertida sobre uma curiosa perseguio , mas tambm um belo estudo de personagens . 
1 lead actress ga , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren . 
1 holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin . 
1 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias romnticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
1 [a] real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
1 the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
0 faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
0 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
0 largely a for-fans artifact . 
0 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
0 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
1 reassuring , retro uplifter . 
0 an awkward and indigestible movie . 
1 sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
1 it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
1 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
0  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
1 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
0 i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
0 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
0 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
1 if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
0 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
0  . . . salaciously simplistic . 
1 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
0 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
1 you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch . 
1 the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness  which makes for a terrifying film . 
1  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
1 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
0 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
1 this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
1 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
0 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
1 the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
0 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
1 gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre . 
0 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
0 life is a crock -- or something like it . 
0 a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
0 shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
1 combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ?
