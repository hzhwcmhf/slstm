1 a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 
1 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
1 there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
1 a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
1 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
0 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
1 a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love . 
1 the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
1 contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
0 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
1 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
0 it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
1 watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
1 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
0 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
1 nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
1 may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
1 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 
0 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
0  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
0  . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
1 while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
1 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
1 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
1 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
0 visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
0 a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
0 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
0 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
1 a chick flick for guys . 
0 it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
1 if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
1 the performances are uniformly good . 
0 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
1 uplifting , funny and wise . 
1 this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
1 it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
1 a wonderful character-based comedy . 
1 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
0 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
1 highly watchable stuff . 
0 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
0 the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
0 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
0 sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
0 what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
0 i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
1 ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
0 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
0 full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . 
0 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
0 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
1 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 
0 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
0 it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
0 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
0 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
0 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
1 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
0 caso voc sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do trmino da projeo , no se preocupe : ningum lhe enviar penas simbolizando covardia . 
0 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
0 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
0 crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
0 anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
0 it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
0 i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
1 the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
1  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
0 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
0 five screenwriters are credited with the clich-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
0  if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
1 metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
0 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
0 just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
0 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
1 secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
0 the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
0 i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
0 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
0 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
1  . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
1 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
1 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
0 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
1  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
1 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie . 
0 this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
0 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
0 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
0 there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
0 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
0 it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
1 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
0 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness . 
0 i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
1 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
0 jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
0 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
0 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
1  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
1 like the best 60 minutes expos , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
1 awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . 
1 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
1 it may not be history  but then again , what if it is ?  but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
0 as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
1 once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . . 
0 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
0 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
0 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
1 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 
1 if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
1 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance . 
1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
1 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
0 no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
0 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
0 hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
1 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
0 it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . 
0 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
1 the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . 
0  . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
1 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life . 
0 more tiring than anything . 
0 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
1 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
1 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
0 benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
0 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
1 for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . 
1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
1 candid camera on methamphetamines . 
1  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
0 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
1 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 
1 it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
0 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
0 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
0 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
0 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
1 visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
0 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
0 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
1 uno de los policiales ms interesantes de los ltimos tiempos . 
1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
0 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
1 a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
0 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
1 baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
0 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
1 if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
1 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
1 a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
1 if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic . 
0 i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
0 the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
0 there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
1 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
1  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
1 a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
0 it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
0 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
0 nothing about this movie works . 
1 jir hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
1 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . 
1 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
0 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
0 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
0 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
1 gives everyone something to shout about . 
0 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
0 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
0 'this movie sucks . '
1 the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
1 spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
1 light , cute and forgettable . 
0 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
0 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
0 it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
1 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
0 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
1 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
1 viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
0 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
0 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
0 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
0 director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
0 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
0 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
0 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
1 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
0 go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
1 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
1 brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
0 despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
1  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
1 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
0 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
0 deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
0 a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
1 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
0 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
0  . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
0 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
0 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
1 most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
0 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
1 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
0 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
0 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
0 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
0 no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
0 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
1 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
1 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description " unelected " have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . 
0 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
0 it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
0 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
0 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
1 it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
0 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
0 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
0 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
0 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
0 a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
0 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
0 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
0 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
0 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .

0 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
0 with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
0 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
1 shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high .

0 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
1 too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . " 
0 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
1 the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did .

0 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
0 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .

0 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
0 it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
0 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
1 real women have curves doesn't offer any easy answers .

1 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness .

0 there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
0 i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed .

0 priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
1 a very charming and funny movie . 
0 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
0 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
0 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
0 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
0 bland but harmless . 
1 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
0 as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
1 it's never dull and always looks good . 
1 norton is magnetic as graham . 
0 a little objectivity could have gone a long way .

1 a muted freak-out
1 ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale  as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
1 easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
1 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
1 a beautiful paean to a time long past . 
1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
1 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
0 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
0 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
0 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
1 it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
0 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
1 has a plot full of twists upon knots . . . and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill . 
1 not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
0 while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
0 alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
1 third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
0 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
0 jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
0 no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuao , harold ramis deve ter sado da cama com o p esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme tambm . 
1 skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . 
0 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
0 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
0 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
0 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
0 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
0  . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
0 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
1 a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
1 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow . 
1 you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
1 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones . 
1 if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
1 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre . 
0 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
0 the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
0 too clever by about nine-tenths . 
1 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
1 tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
0 godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
0 the comedy is nonexistent . 
1 graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake . 
0 when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
1 ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate . 
1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
0 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
0 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
1 world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . 
1 while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 
1 the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment . 
1 everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
0 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
0 cinematic poo . 
0 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
0 holden caulfield did it better . 
1 it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho . 
0 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
0 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
0 one of the worst movies of the year . 
0 what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
0 the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .

0 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
0 dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?

0 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
0 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
1 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . 
0 it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .

1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
0 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
0 aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
0 a dreary movie . 
0 director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
1 it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
0 the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
0 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
1 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
0 it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
0 things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .

0 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
1 although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
0 it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
0 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
0 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them .

1 a well-executed spy-thriller . 
1 secretary " is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
0 it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
1 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
0 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
1 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
0 as social expos , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on .

1 a moving , if uneven , success . 
0 an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
0 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
0 skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
0 a noble failure .

0 generic thriller junk . teens only . 
1 there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
0 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
1  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
0 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
0 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
1 a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
0 involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
1 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
0 an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
1 a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . 
0 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
0 granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
0 frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
0 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
1 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
1 a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
0 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
0 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
1 [has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true . 
1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) thirdemotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
1 astonishingly skillful and moving . . . it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one . 
0 while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
0 everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
1 mnch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 
0 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
0 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
1 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
1 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
1 a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
1 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital . 
1 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
0 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
0 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
0 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
0 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
1 culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield .

1 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
0 it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
1  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
0 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
0 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
1 surprisingly insightful
0 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
0 director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
1 twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
0 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
1 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
0 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
0 whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
1 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
1 great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
0 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
1 a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 
0 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
1 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
0 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
0 terminally brain dead production . 
0 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
0 you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
0 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
1 watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia .

1 payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business . 
1 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
1  . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor . 
0 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
0 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
0 a processed comedy chop suey . 
1 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary .

1 it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
1 ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he's well worth spending some time with . 
0 under-rehearsed and lifeless
0 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
1 a good piece of work more often than not . 
1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
0 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
1 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 
1 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
0  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
1 has its share of arresting images . 
1 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
0 it's all surface psychodramatics . 
1  . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
1 whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
0 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
1 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 
1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
1 i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
0 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
1 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear . 
0 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
1 it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ?

0 brisk hack job . 
1 not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
0 the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on bttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
1 i couldn't recommend this film more . 
1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
0 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
0 a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true .

1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
1 the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 
1 boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer .

1 caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely .

1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
0 just one bad idea after another . 
1 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
0 believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
1 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
1 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
1 in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
0 one of the most incoherent features in recent memory .

1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
0 feeble comedy . 
0 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
1 [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
0 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
1 the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
1 campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . 
1 cool ? this movie is a snow emergency . 
0 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
0 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
0 this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
1 sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
1 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
1 the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
0 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
0 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
1 all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 
0 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
0 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
0 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
0 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
0 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
0 kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
1 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
1 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable . 
0 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
0 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
0 plays like john le carr with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
0 julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
0 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable navet and arbitrary flashbacks . 
0 do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
0 less than fresh . 
1 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
0 van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
0 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
0 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
1 this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
1 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
1 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
1 a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
0 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
0 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
1 this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
1 resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
0  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
1 its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . 
0  . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
1 the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
0 a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
1 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
1 though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
0 a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
1 it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
0 ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
1 so beautifully acted and directed , it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
1 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 
1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
0 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
1 katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
0 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
1 a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
1 you'll end up moved . 
0 basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
0 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
1 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
1  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 
0 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
0 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
0 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
0 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
0 shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
0 the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
0 its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
1 an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences the chteau is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten . 
0 like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
1 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
1  . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichs to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
1 it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
0 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
0 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
1 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
0 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
0 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
0 when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
1 eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
0 is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
0 it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
0 if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
0 when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
0 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
1 the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events . 
1 the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
1 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
0 'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
1 sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodramticos para arrancar lgrimas do espectador , o pianista  um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
1  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation . 
0 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
0 at once half-baked and overheated . 
1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
0 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
1 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
1 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
1 douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 
1 with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
1 [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
0 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
0 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
1 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
1 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now . 
0 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
0 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
0 the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
0 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
1  the film is powerful , accessible and funny . you won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well . 
0 the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
1 moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 
0 the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
1 mais um momento inspirado de david fincher . 
1 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother .
